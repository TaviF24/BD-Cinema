# Cinema Database

## Description
This project is about the organisation of a cinema as a database.

## The files
It contains 3 files:
- The [133_Farcasi_George_Octavian-creare_inserare.txt](133_Farcasi_George_Octavian-creare_inserare.txt) file has all the commands used for creating the tables and inserting the data in them;
- The [133_Farcasi_George_Octavian-exemple.txt](133_Farcasi_George_Octavian-exemple.txt) file contains some exercises in Romanian, related to the cinema database, made by me;
- The [133_Farcasi_George_Octavian-proiect.docx](133_Farcasi_George_Octavian-proiect.docx) file has a presentation made in Microsoft Word which has more details about the tables and how I created them.

>[!NOTE]
>All the commands from the files are as comments.
